# Scratchteroids
 A little game I made in scratch. I used TurboWarp to make it into an EXE file. Controls are as follows  
 
 W/S: Fowards and Backwards 
 
 A/D: Turn Left and Right  
 
 SPACE: Shoot  R: Retro Mode (All sprites are black and white)  
 
 M: Modern Mode (All sprites have color)  
 
 C: Change ship color (Does not have any effect on Retro Mode)
